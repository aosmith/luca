# Computed Properties Support
# ###
#
# Luca.Model supports computed properties, which are 
# object methods which are composed of model attributes or
# of calculations which are dependent on these attributes.

# When these model attributes change, the computed property
# needs to be re-evaluated.  
#
# The configuration API for computed properties expects a hash
# whose keys are the name of the method, and whose value is
# an array of the attribute dependencies for that method.
